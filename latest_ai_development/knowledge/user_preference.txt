- **Areas of Interest (for learning):** AI Agents, advanced Deep Learning (PyTorch), and Reinforcement Learning.

## Answer Preferences
- **Tone:** Direct and technical, but use analogies for Reinforcement Learning concepts, as it's my weaker area.
- **Depth:** It's not necessary to explain basic ML concepts like linear regression or classification.
- **Code:** Prioritize PyTorch over TensorFlow. Code should be clean (PEP 8) and well-commented.
- **Location:** San Francisco, CA. (Helpful if asked for examples of local events or companies.)
